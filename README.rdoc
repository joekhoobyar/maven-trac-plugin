Maven Plugin for Trac.

Forked from the Google Code project at http://code.google.com/p/maven-trac-plugin/ owned by *wadahiro*.  The goals of this fork are:

* Add additional mojos for interacting with Trac, such as version administration.
* Provide additional lifecycle hooks for the project release cycle.
* maybe more?
